/* 
    Selectance works by removing the basic select element and uses other generated elements instead.
    So it can be anoying to customize the style.

    This file helps you to customize multiselectors.
    Link it to the html after the base css (selectance-style.css) to overwrite 
    the style with yours or use it alone to start from scratch.

    The selectors are listed. Just add the properties. üëç

    ! Unless you know what you are doing, do not overwrite the properties that are recommended you to not be overwrited.
    ! They are part of the main mecanic.
    ! Overwriting them can lead to unwanted behavior.
    ! Any other property in this file is for accessibility purpose. You can modify them.
